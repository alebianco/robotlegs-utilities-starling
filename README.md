# RoboStarlegs: Starling integration for Robotlegs2

RoboStarlegs allows you to use [Robotlegs](http://www.robotlegs.org/) with [Starling](http://gamua.com/starling/) and any other library based on that, like [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/), in the same fashion you'd use it with the regular Flash display list or Flex.
